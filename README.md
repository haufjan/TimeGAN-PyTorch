### Motivation
  The inital TimeGAN code was written using Tensorflow 1, now being deprecated.

  Original TimeGAN codebase:

### Notebook
  The provided notebook is organized as a workflow of subsequent tasks.

##### GPU-Support
  Since extensive training over a considerable number of iterations (epochs) demands vast computional power it is advisable and practical to rely on GPU (or other      resources that offer accelerated computations).
