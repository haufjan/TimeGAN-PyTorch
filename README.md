### Motivation
  The initial TimeGAN code is based on Tensorflow 1, now being deprecated.

  Original TimeGAN codebase:

### Notebook
  The provided notebook is organized in chapters of subsequent tasks. It aims at presenting the complex framework in a simple and comprehensible way.

##### GPU-Support
  As extensive training over a considerable number of iterations (epochs) demands vast computional power it is advisable and practical to rely on GPU (or other       resources that offer accelerated computations).

  For example, Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) grants limited access to GPU resources free of charge.
